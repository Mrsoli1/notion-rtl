# RTL Notion Persian Text

A Chrome extension that automatically applies RTL (Right-to-Left) direction to Persian texts in Notion. This extension ensures that only Persian texts are right-aligned, leaving English texts unaffected.

## Features

- Automatically detects Persian text and applies RTL direction.
- Ensures that lists (bulleted, numbered, toggle) and pseudo-elements are also RTL when they contain Persian text.
- Simple and lightweight.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rtl-notion-persian-text.git
